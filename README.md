# WCGS Project

This is my undergraduate project.  
I worked on a clinical dataset to explore associations between several health-related variables and a four-group outcome variable called `behpat` (A1, A2, B3, B4), using **Multinomial Logistic Regression** in R. 

Key steps included:
- Data cleaning  
- Handling missing values and detecting outliers  
- Building and comparing multiple regression models  
- Evaluating model performance (AIC, prediction accuracy)
- Final report in RMarkdown format

This was one of my first experiences working with real clinical data and applying statistical methods to extract meaningful insights.  

The repository contains:

- `WCGS.R`: the R script used for analysis  
- `WCGS_data.sav`: the cleaned dataset (SPSS format)  
- `WCGS_report.Rmd`: R Markdown source of the analysis report  
- `WCGS_report.html`: rendered HTML report  
- `references.bib`: bibliography file used in the report  
- `apa.csl`: APA citation style for formatting references
